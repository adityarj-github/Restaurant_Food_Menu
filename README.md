🍴 Restaurant Food Menu App
The Restaurant Food Menu App is a responsive web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase a restaurant’s food offerings in a clean and user-friendly interface. The app displays a list of menu items categorized by type—such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, and Drinks—making it easy for users to explore the options.

Each item features a name, image, price, and short description. Users can filter menu items by category or use the search bar to find specific dishes quickly. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring smooth usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Built with reusable React components and styled using Tailwind’s utility classes, the app is lightweight, fast, and easy to customize or scale. It can be connected to a local JSON file or an external API for dynamic content.
